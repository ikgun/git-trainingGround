/*
The objective of this game is to travel the entire game board of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls.

Roll the die for the user (generate a Random number between 1 – 6) and advance the user that number
of spaces on the game board. Here’s the code to do this ((import is java.util.Random):

After each roll, tell the user which game space they are on and how many more spaces they have to go to win.

Repeat this 4 additional times, for 5 rolls in total.

However, if the user gets to 20 before 5 rolls, end the game - they’ve won.

If they are greater than or less than 20 spaces exactly, they lose.

Remember there are only 20 spaces on the board, so a message like “You advanced to space 22” is a bug.
